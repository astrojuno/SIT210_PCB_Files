SIT210 10.1HD

My PCB design is purposefully simple. I designed my embedded system to achieve my goal as simply as possible. 

My PCB conforms to the Feather Standards and is intended to be used with the Particle Boron. The overall size is correct, and the rounded corners fit with the aesthetics of the Particle Boron. The mounting holes conform to the standard, allowing for the use of cases later on in the design process. 

Soldering holes allow the Particle Boron to be easily attached. 3 LEDâ€™s are attached to display device communication with the home station, whether a parking spot is available, and if there is traffic. A buzzer can be activated with a switch to provide audio feedback when there is a parking space also.

The electrical runs are done over 2 layers, allowing power and ground to be shared amongst the components. 

The design conforms to the PCB Design Rule Checks suggested by Easy EDA.
